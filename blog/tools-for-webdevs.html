      <p>
        In 2025, web development continues to evolve at lightning speed. Whether you’re a front-end designer, back-end engineer, or full-stack developer, the right tools can significantly improve your efficiency and code quality. Fortunately, many of the best developer tools are completely free — offering everything from code editors to deployment platforms.  
      </p>

      <h2>1. Visual Studio Code</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Code editing and debugging<br>
        Visual Studio Code (VS Code) remains the most popular free code editor in 2025. It supports multiple programming languages, integrated Git control, IntelliSense, and a huge library of extensions for frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js.  
      </p>

      <h2>2. Git and GitHub</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Version control and collaboration<br>
        Git lets you manage your code history locally, while GitHub provides cloud storage and collaboration tools. With GitHub Actions, developers can automate deployment, testing, and CI/CD workflows — all for free.  
      </p>

      <h2>3. Postman</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> API testing and automation<br>
        Postman simplifies API requests and helps developers test endpoints quickly. You can organize APIs in collections, set environment variables, and even automate tests to ensure stable integrations between your frontend and backend systems.  
      </p>

      <h2>4. Netlify</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Free hosting and continuous deployment<br>
        Netlify allows developers to deploy websites directly from GitHub or GitLab with a single click. It includes serverless functions, SSL certificates, form handling, and continuous integration — perfect for personal projects or client portfolios.  
      </p>

      <h2>5. Tailwind CSS</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Rapid UI development<br>
        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that lets you design modern, responsive UIs quickly. Instead of writing custom CSS, you can combine predefined utility classes to create sleek, consistent layouts with minimal code.  
      </p>

      <h2>6. Chrome DevTools</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Debugging and performance optimization<br>
        Chrome DevTools is built into Google Chrome and gives developers full control over inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time. It’s perfect for debugging layout issues, measuring performance, and identifying bottlenecks.  
      </p>

      <h2>7. Figma</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> UI/UX design collaboration<br>
        Figma offers free, cloud-based collaborative design capabilities. Developers and designers can work together on wireframes, prototypes, and interfaces — ensuring a smooth design-to-code transition.  
      </p>

      <h2>8. Cloudflare</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Speed, security, and CDN services<br>
        Cloudflare’s free plan offers a powerful global content delivery network (CDN), DDoS protection, and DNS management. It helps reduce latency and protects your sites from common security threats.  
      </p>

      <h2>9. CodePen</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Frontend experimentation and sharing<br>
        CodePen is a browser-based code editor that lets developers experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets instantly. It’s a great place to showcase work, debug small projects, or learn new techniques by exploring public pens.  
      </p>

      <h2>10. Responsively App</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Multi-device testing<br>
        Responsively App is an open-source desktop tool that mirrors your website across multiple device screens at once. It helps you ensure your web projects look perfect on desktops, tablets, and smartphones without switching devices repeatedly.  
      </p>

      <h2>Bonus Recommendations</h2>
